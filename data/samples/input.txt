Woodward, Oklahoma, August 1965
 
As I sit perched on the upper floor of my Pullman car, stirring from my slumber, I watch the platform of Woodward's small station already receding into the distance. The rhythmic clacking of the Atcheson, Topeka and Santa Fe's wheels on the tracks reminds me that I am locked up for two days and two nights in a steel cage rolling on steel.
 Then there is the ocher, gray plain, the blinding reddish dust under the steel blue sky, dotted with dried bushes and that almost lunar horizon, flat for three hundred and sixty degrees all around, without a shrub, without a mound, without the slightest monument rising even slightly except its immense grain silo with multiple towers, windowless, standing behind the small station like a medieval fortress in the middle of this ghastly land, the largest no man's land on the planet.
No man's land—better known by its unofficial name, the Cimarron Territory, it's the famous Panhandle, this strip of land shaped like the handle of a pan, extending 170 miles, which stretches Oklahoma along its border with Kansas to the north and Texas to the southwest. Harboring traces of human habitation dating back several millennia, once populated by the Cherokees and Sioux and opened to settlers starting in 1889, this region was hit by drought in the 1930s. Poor land management led to dust storms swirling for several summers, earning it the nickname of Dust Bowl, forcing farmers struck by the Great Depression to emigrate to California in the hope of a better future, only to find John Steinbeck's grapes of wrath.
Seated on the upper deck of the air-conditioned Pullman car, I watch the town recede and disappear into the horizon. Although it is not part of the Panhandle, but of what was once called the Cherokee Outlet, with three other localities Woodward served as the starting point for the settlers' rush westward in 1893. Troops were stationed there to oversee the orderly occupation of the new territories opened to white settlers after their purchase from their Native American occupants by the federal government in the aftermath of the Civil War.

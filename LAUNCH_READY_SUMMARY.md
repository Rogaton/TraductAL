## 💡 Recommendations

### My Strong Recommendations:
1. ✅ **Launch this week** (Option C is low-risk)
2. ✅ **Start with academic audience** (your natural community)
3. ✅ **Monitor feedback** before big commercial push
4. ✅ **Iterate quickly** based on real usage

### Optional But Helpful:
- 🔄 Test installation on fresh machine/VM
- 🔄 Have colleague review README
- 🔄 Create screencast demo (5-minute video)
- 🔄 Prepare FAQ based on likely questions

### Can Wait Until Later:
- ⏳ Legal review (unless you get immediate commercial inquiry)
- ⏳ Professional website (GitHub is fine initially)
- ⏳ Formal support system (email is fine for now)
- ⏳ Payment infrastructure (wait for first inquiry)

## ❓ Decision Time

**Question**: Are you ready to launch this week?

### If YES:
1. Fill out `YOUR_INFO_HERE.md` now
2. Let me know when done
3. I'll update all placeholders
4. Follow GITHUB_SETUP_GUIDE.md
5. You'll be live in ~1 hour

### If MAYBE (need a few days):
1. Review all documentation this weekend
2. Test installation yourself
3. Show to 1-2 colleagues for feedback
4. Then fill out YOUR_INFO_HERE.md
5. Launch early next week

### If NOT YET (need more time):
That's fine! The codebase is ready when you are. Take your time to:
- Test thoroughly
- Get legal review
- Build confidence
- Choose the right moment

No pressure. The work is done. Now it's just about timing.

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've built something significant:
- **Technical achievement**: Hybrid neural-symbolic system
- **Academic contribution**: Computational linguistics research
- **Practical utility**: Real translation tool
- **Community resource**: Open-source for all

The hardest part (building it) is done. Now comes the fun part (sharing it)!

---

## 📞 What's Next?

**Tell me**:
1. Are you ready to fill out YOUR_INFO_HERE.md?
2. Any concerns or questions before launching?
3. Do you want to test anything first?

I'm here to help with whatever you need!

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I try TraductAL before purchasing a commercial license?**
A: Yes! Use the MIT License for 90-day evaluation. Full source code access, no limitations.

**Q: Do you offer discounts for non-profits?**
A: Yes. Registered non-profits (501c3 or equivalent) qualify for free MIT License for mission-related use.

**Q: Can you guarantee translation quality?**
A: Translation quality varies by language pair and domain. We provide quality reports and can fine-tune for your needs, but no MT system is perfect. Human review is recommended for critical content.

**Q: How does TraductAL compare to Google Translate or DeepL?**
A: Different markets. Google/DeepL excel at high-resource languages and cloud convenience. TraductAL excels at low-resource languages, privacy, and customization. We're not competitors; we're complementary.

**Q: What if my language isn't supported?**
A: We can add it! Custom language support is available through professional services. Requires parallel corpus data (examples of text in your language + translation).

**Q: Can I resell TraductAL?**
A: Yes, with an OEM/Redistribution License (custom pricing). Contact us for terms.

**Q: Do you provide support for open-source users (MIT License)?**
A: Community support only (GitHub issues). Paid licenses include formal support with SLA.

**Q: What's your stance on academic/commercial research collaboration?**
A: We actively encourage it! Contact us for partnership opportunities. We're interested in joint grants, publications, and advancing translation technology.

**Q: How do you handle GDPR/data privacy regulations?**
A: TraductAL runs entirely on your infrastructure (on-premise or your cloud account). We never see your data. You control all data residency and compliance. For hosted services (coming soon), we'll offer GDPR-compliant EU deployments.

**Q: Can you help us decide if we need a commercial license?**
A: Yes! Email us with your use case. We'll provide a clear licensing recommendation at no charge.

- Regional languages: Occitan, Friulian, Ladin, Sardinian
- Plus 50+ mainstream languages

**Use Cases for Your Work**:
1. **Educational materials**: Translate learning content into endangered languages
2. **Documentation**: Preserve and translate cultural/historical texts
3. **Community access**: Provide translation tools offline (important for remote areas)
4. **Custom glossaries**: Enforce traditional terminology and cultural context

**What We Offer**:
- **Free software** (download and use forever)
- **Customization support**: Add your language or improve existing support
- **Collaboration**: Work together on glossaries and grammar rules
- **No data collection**: Your translations stay private

**How to Get Started**:
1. Visit: [Repository URL]
2. Follow installation guide (or try online demo)
3. Contact me to discuss customization for your language

**Collaboration Opportunities**:
- Add support for your language (if not yet included)

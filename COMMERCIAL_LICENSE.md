## If You Find It Valuable

If TraductAL helps your business and you want to support continued development:

### 💝 Donations Welcome

**Why?**
- Supports an independent researcher (me) vs. corporate alternatives
- Funds new features, languages, and improvements
- Keeps the project open-source and community-focused

**How?**
- Contact: relanir@bluewin.ch
- We'll discuss what makes sense
- No obligation - the code stays free regardless

### 🤝 Collaboration

I'm open to:
- **Consulting** on linguistic aspects (grammar design, translation quality, NLP strategy)
- **Custom development** if it aligns with my expertise
- **Research partnerships** for academic-industry projects
- **Sponsoring specific features** you need

**What I'm good at:**
- Computational linguistics
- Grammar formalism (DCG)
- NLP and translation approaches
- French/English technical writing

**What I'm NOT:**
- IT consultant
- System administrator
- DevOps engineer
- 24/7 support team

## Third-Party Components (Important!)

TraductAL integrates models with their own licenses:

### NLLB-200 (Meta AI)
- **License**: CC-BY-NC 4.0
- **Restriction**: Non-commercial use only
- **Impact**: If you're using TraductAL commercially, you CANNOT use NLLB-200

### For Commercial Use
You must either:
1. Use only Apertus-8B (Apache 2.0 - commercial OK)
2. Fine-tune your own model
3. Get separate commercial license from Meta for NLLB-200

**My TraductAL code is MIT (free for all). The models have their own rules.**

## Legal Stuff (Simple Version)

**MIT License means:**
- You can use TraductAL for anything
- Commercial or non-commercial
- No fees to me
- Just keep the copyright notice in the code
- No warranty (use at your own risk)

**My liability:**
- I built this as research software
- It works, but I'm not guaranteeing anything
- If something breaks, you fix it or hire someone
- I'm not responsible for your business outcomes

**If you want help:** Contact me. We discuss. We agree on fair terms. Simple.

**That's it. No "tiers", no "audit rights", no corporate nonsense.**

**Use the software. If it helps you make money, consider supporting me. Otherwise, enjoy it for free.**

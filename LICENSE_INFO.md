- Must maintain client confidentiality (system supports this)

**Required**: Basic attribution if sharing system

### **üè¢ Internal Business Use**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **PERMITTED**
- Use within organization for internal translations
- Deploy on company servers
- Integrate with internal tools
- Train employees on system

**Conditions**: Cannot offer as external service to other companies

**Required**: Basic attribution in internal documentation

### **üí∞ Commercial Services**
**Status**: ‚ùå **REQUIRES META LICENSE**
- Selling translation services using NLLB-200
- SaaS translation platforms
- API services using NLLB-200
- Large-scale commercial operations

**Solution**: Contact Meta for commercial licensing

### **üîß Software Development**
**Status**: üü° **MIXED**
- ‚úÖ Can use integration framework commercially
- ‚úÖ Can sell setup and customization services
- ‚úÖ Can create commercial tools around the framework
- ‚ùå Cannot redistribute NLLB-200 models commercially

---

## üéØ **Practical Recommendations**

### **For Individual Translators**
```
‚úÖ DO:
- Use for all your translation work
- Share setup with colleagues
- Customize for your needs
- Charge clients for your translation services

‚ùå DON'T:
- Advertise "NLLB-200 translation services"
- Sell the models themselves
- Create commercial APIs using NLLB-200
```

### **For Organizations**
```
‚úÖ DO:
- Deploy internally for employee use
- Use for internal document translation
- Integrate with internal workflows
- Train staff on the system

‚ùå DON'T:
- Offer as external service to clients
- Include in commercial products
- Resell translation services based on NLLB-200
```

### **For Educators**
```
‚úÖ DO:
- Use in courses and training
- Share with students
- Include in research projects
- Publish academic papers about implementation

‚ùå DON'T:
- Sell commercial training based solely on NLLB-200
- Include in paid commercial courses without proper licensing
```

## üìû **Getting Proper Licenses**

### **For Commercial NLLB-200 Use**
1. **Contact Meta**: opensource@meta.com
2. **Specify use case**: Describe your intended commercial application
3. **Negotiate terms**: Work out licensing fees and conditions
4. **Get written agreement**: Ensure proper legal documentation

### **Alternative Approaches**
1. **Use MT5 instead**: More permissive licensing for commercial use
2. **Hybrid approach**: Commercial framework + user-downloaded models
3. **Service-based**: Sell setup, training, and support services
4. **Consulting**: Offer implementation and customization services

## üîç **License Verification**

### **How to Check Current Licenses**
```bash
# Check NLLB-200 model license
cat models/deployed_models/nllb_200_1.3b/README.md

# Check Transformers license
python3 -c "import transformers; print(transformers.__file__)"
# Then check LICENSE file in that directory

# Check PyTorch license
python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.__file__)"
# Then check LICENSE file in that directory
```

### **Staying Updated**
- **NLLB-200**: Check Hugging Face model pages for latest terms
